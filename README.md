# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

UNIT TEST ARE DONE Locally (for small portion of code ...)
-> local hardhat 
-> forked hardhat 

```
Staging tests can be done on a testnet (LAST STOP BEFORE DEPLOYMENT !!!!!);

deploy - deploying the smartcontract on networks
scripts - interacting with smart contracts (scripts works on already deployed contracts) 
test - testing the smart contract working properly before deploying to a network
frontend - once a smart contract is deployed you can interact with already deployed account using contract address, abi and signer(account which is connected) , frontend is connected to metamask which is connected to a node of the blockchain underthe hood  , once forntend is connected to metamask we can post request through metamask api...

 ```
